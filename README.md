# Seasonal Bike Rental Analysis

## Project Objective:
To build a simple web application using **ML Regression Models** that will allow users to explore data through a user-friendly interface and answer business-related questions.

## Business Problem
This project aims to optimize bike rental operations in Seoul by leveraging data-driven insights. By analyzing various factors affecting bike rentals, we can improve resource allocation, enhance user experience, and potentially increase revenue for the bike rental service. 

## Dataset Overview
The original dataset has the following information:

Entries: 8760

Data Types: float64(6), int64(4), object(4)

Data columns (total 14 columns):

| 11 | Seasons                       | 8760 non-null  | object  |
| 12 | Holiday                       | 8760 non-null  | object  |
| 13 | Functioning Day               | 8760 non-null  | object  |

## Project Objectives
+ Identify and quantify the top 3-5 factors influencing bike rental demand in Seoul, providing actionable insights for operational decision-making.
+ Develop a regression model to predict hourly bike rental demand with at least 85% accuracy.
+ Design and deploy an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to test the regression model through an intuitive interface.

## Specific Questions/Insights Provided
+ What are the most significant factors influencing bike rental demand in Seoul?
+ How do seasonal changes and weather conditions impact bike rental patterns?
+ Are there any trends or patterns in bike rental usage during holidays or specific hours of the day?
+ How does air quality (visibility) affect bike rental behavior?

## Value Generation for the Organization
+ Efficient Bike Distribution: Enabling more efficient bike distribution across the city based on predicted demand.
+ Marketing Strategies: Informing marketing strategies to boost rentals during typically low-usage times.
+ Financial Planning: Assisting in budget allocation and financial planning based on expected rental patterns.
+ Customer Satisfaction: Improving customer satisfaction by ensuring bike availability during high-demand periods.

## Installation
